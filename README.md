# Soukoban-Disassembly
Disassembly of Soukoban (倉庫番) for Gameboy. I wanted to do a project with Gameboy assembly, and since I'm interested in disassembly and reverse engineering, I thought disassembling a simple game would be a fun start. I chose the Japanese version because I happened to pick up a copy of it at a local Half Price Books. ^-^
